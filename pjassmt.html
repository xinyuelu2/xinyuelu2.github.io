        <h1>PROJECT</h1>
        
        <h3>ECON30006 | student number:1938704 </h3>
        <p>Nintento Co., Ltd's, a well-known multinational vedio games corporate estabilished in Japan around 1950, is involved in the family entertainment primarily. Its high quality of games, sufficient creativity of game plots, charming amination characters and ample gameplay attract a large-scale customer with almost all age and gender groups. Close combination between hardwares and softwares that you are able to play their first-party tittles only on the nintendo switch promises the hardware development and volumes. Therefore, this project will roughly elaborate relationship between net sales and profits, handware and software sale volumes , and research and development and advertising expense, based on Nintendo income statements and annual report. Sequentially, influence from chip shortage and stock prices compared with other companies such as Sony and Microsoft would be analysed simply.

        </p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart1"> </div>

        <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18FUsbjE2QqMKgO9qo31Qn9Rnw9AJDfy1?usp=sharing" id="link1">chart1 google colab</a>

        <p>The first chart displays the net sales, gross profit ratio and operating profit ratio in Nintendo’s income statement. As for net sales, it increases from 24 billion to 1838 billion yen over 29 years staring from 1980 approximately, while it plummeted since 2009 by nearly 1350billion yen. The overall upside tendency of gross profits ratio (dark green line) and operating profit ratio (light green line) encountered a plunge around 2011. Figures in recent years show Nintendo’s extraordinary recovery capability. </p>

          
        <div class="#chart" id="Chart2"> </div>

        <p>The second chart is a connected scatterplot chart, instead of a regression model because data collected is insufficient. If the line in regression model based on such data, there would exist considerable bias. In the chart2, the flatter slope indicates that less expense could obtain more net sales. Compared to selling, an increase in general administration expense would improve net sales less, which means investment in research, development and advertisement may have a significant impact on net sales as following charts revealed. Three lines all have the time trend that leftist points are starting points in 2018. Connected segments between two points indicate the next year directions and the efficiency between net sales and expense in this year. These three lines all presented a sudden turn from 2021 to 2022. It may relate to the chip shortage, which would be talked later.</p>

    
        <div class="#chart" id="Chart3"> </div>
        <p>

        <p>In the third bubble chart indicates, though figures are not enough to set up a regression model, the disparity between sales of hardware and software in both two charts illustrates highly positive correlation between software sales and operating expense. Moreover, software sales to advertising expense slope seems steeper in the bottom chart, which means advertising expense may have a considerable influence on software sales, compared to research and development sector. </p>
      
        
        <div class="#chart" id="Chart4"> </div>

        <p>The fourth area chart without switch OLED model switch owing to its latest published year. The consumption by American accounts for the most recently, whatever hardware or software. European consumption is approximately equivalent to Japan’s hardware sales, while its software sales were larger than Japanese. In the hardware section, there is an apparent decrease in 2022, which might be related to the yen depreciation and chip shortages. The latter would be displayed as followed. </p>

        
        <div class="#chart" id="Chart5"> </div>

        <p>With the uncertainty to supply chain under coronavirus pandemic, war between Russia and Ukraine and trade war between America and China, the escalating difference between demands and supply might force Nintendo to reduce the expected sales of switches. Hence, the IP index and Nintendo hardware sales showed a drop in 2022 in the fifth chart. The comparable tendency of two lines may imply positive correlation between chip shortage and Nintendo hardware sales. </p>
        
        <div class="#chart" id="Chart6"> </div>

        <p>In the last chart, large price gap indicates a material upside or room for improvement for Nintendo, albeit with its stable stock prices in the upper chart. For Microsoft corporate, despite its impressive plunge from 2021, it seemed to keep its stock price change in the bottom chart, compared to Sony’s fluctuation of price changes.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, relationship between product sale volumes and operating expense in research and advertisement, sale volumes distributed in 3 regions, impact of semiconductor shortage and comparison with other corporates in stock price have been simply analyzed. Despite, some shortcomings, Nintendo is considered as a promising company. Besides, the report analysis with insufficient data is not able to keep noise away. How expenses influence product sales and what the relationship between chip shortage and Nintendo sales is like need further research. Furthermore, the age and gender distribution, Nintendo IP derivatives goods and Super Mario world in Universal Studios attendance volumes could be good research directions on Nintendo game and IP’s influence.</p>
